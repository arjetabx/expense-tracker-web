# expense-tracker-web

A simple **expense tracker web application** built with **Vue 3 (Vite + TailwindCSS)** for the frontend and **Spring Boot** for the backend.  
This project allows users to add expenses, categorize them (e.g., Food, Travel, Shopping), and view them in an organised way.
- Previous project added to github from gitlab, also making refinements.

### Backend (Spring Boot)

mvn spring-boot:run

cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
